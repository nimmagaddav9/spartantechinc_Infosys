## 1. Introduce yourself?

I’m a Full‑Stack developer with 12+ years building .com sites using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and Redux.

- **Recent (last 2 years):**  
  – React migration on United.com, converting .NET pages to React  
  – Built UIs with ATMOS (in‑house React component library)  
  – Implemented security/account features:

  - Forgot password / MileagePlus number
  - Security questions, sign‑in flows
  - Miles‑Pooling, United Club pass, recent activity dashboards
  - Known Traveler Number (KTN) integration
  - WCAG‑compliant accessibility features  
    – Used Redux‑Saga for organized async tasks (API calls, data fetching)

- **Key initiatives:**  
  Miles‑Pooling, TSA PreCheck, enhanced account security & management, under‑18 support

- **Earlier roles:**
  - **Visa (Accelerator team):** Remediated MBDA modules (App & Account Management, Portfolio Management, Analytics, Recurring Billing, Virtual Terminal) for clients like Wells Fargo and Bank of America
  - **Capital Group (DAVIS Project):**
    - Data visualization with Highcharts in React, integrated into AEM (backend in Java)
    - Developed Creative Workbench—a content authoring tool for Capital Group websites
  - **Cerner Corporation:** Built medical examination form workflows
  - **Office Depot:** Worked on Black Friday reporting
  - **Satinos Technologies:** Created a tax portal and a Schoomin website for the Vignan schools

## 1. How have you designed and built a content management workflow end‑to‑end?

**Answer:**  
I started by mapping out user roles and their permissions—editors, reviewers, admins. Then I chose a headless CMS (e.g. Contentful) for its API flexibility. On the UI side, I built React components that fetch and render content via GraphQL. I added preview modes so authors can review changes before publishing. Finally, I layered in audit logs and versioning on the backend—implemented in Java with Spring Boot—to track who changed what and when.

## 2. What’s your approach to integrating Java‑based backends with a modern JavaScript front end?

**Answer:**  
I expose REST or GraphQL endpoints from a Java service—usually Spring MVC or Spring Boot. On the UI side, I use Axios or Fetch within React hooks (useEffect) to pull data. I handle authentication with JWTs issued by the Java auth server. If performance is critical, I’ll batch requests or use caching headers. Error handling bubbles errors into a centralized error boundary in React so the UI stays predictable.

## 3. How do you ensure a UI remains performant as the application scales?

**Answer:**  
First, I split my app with code‑splitting and lazy‑load heavy modules with React.lazy. I use memoization (useMemo, React.memo) to avoid needless re‑renders. For large lists, I implement windowing (react‑window). On the backend, I paginate and limit data. I also set up Lighthouse audits and track Core Web Vitals in production, so I can catch regressions early.

## 4. Describe a time you enforced best practices in a content management project.

**Answer:**  
On one project, content was living in both DB fields and Markdown files—total chaos. I introduced a schema: all rich text in the headless CMS and configuration in JSON. I documented components that consume that content, enforced linting for Markdown, and added a CI step to reject schema‑breaking changes. That cut down our “broken pages” incidents by 80%.

## 5. How do you balance UI/UX polish with rapid delivery needs?

**Answer:**  
Here’s the thing—I break work into two passes. First pass is functionality: components work, content flows, Java contracts honored. Second pass is polish: accessibility (WCAG), responsive tweaks, animations. If deadlines are tight, I communicate clearly which UX items will shift into the polish sprint so stakeholders stay aligned.

## 6. What Java frameworks have you used for backend integration, and why?

**Answer:**  
I gravitate toward Spring Boot for microservices—its auto‑configuration and mature ecosystem speed up development. For content‑heavy workflows, I’ve used Spring Data JPA for transactional safety, and sometimes played with Quarkus when startup time mattered. In every case, I wrap business logic in services, keep controllers thin, and expose only the endpoints the UI needs.

---

## 7. How would you troubleshoot a production issue where content updates aren’t appearing in the UI?

**Answer:**  
I’d start by checking the HTTP response: is the CMS change visible via Postman? If not, I look at the Java service logs—maybe caching is stale. If yes, I inspect the front end: are we hitting the correct endpoint? I’ll reproduce in dev with mock data, turn on network logging in the browser, and step through the React state. Usually it’s a header cache‑control or a missing dependency in useEffect.

## 8. What’s your process for collaborating with an offshore team?

**Answer:**  
I schedule overlapping hours—say 8–10 AM CST—to sync up. We use Confluence for specs and Jira for tickets with clear acceptance criteria. I record short Loom demos of UI flows. For code reviews, I add detailed comments and encourage questions. That way, when they’re offline, work doesn’t stall, and when we reconnect, it moves forward smoothly.

---

## 9. How do you tag or highlight “rapid‑scale” or “hyper‑growth” requirements in a job spec when you read one?

**Answer:**  
I look for phrases like “scale to millions of users,” “rapid feature rollout,” or “fast‑paced environment.” Then I prepare examples: e.g. “At X company, we rolled out UI features to 500k users in under a week by containerizing services and leveraging feature flags.” I bring that into my answers to show I’ve thrived in that context.

## 10. Why is on‑site Day 1 presence important, and how do you plan for it?

**Answer:**  
Being on‑site Day 1 means I can hit the ground running—set up dev environments, meet the team face‑to‑face, and dive into architecture whiteboards. I’ll confirm hardware, VPN/ID access, and test my environment before Day 1. That way, I avoid delays and can start delivering by Week 1.
